She began making photo series in 2018 where she covered topics from car sickness to self-expression, and deeper topics such as bullying and vulnerability in the black community. She then started to incorporate videography by writing and directing trailers for her series’. Her love for filmmaking grew over the years which led up to her writing and directing two independent short films, ‘The Cleaning Lady’ and ‘Vegan Diet’, which were featured at the 2022 SOMA Film Festival. Nina-Simone has also proudly collaborated with Cinema Ed and Drew University for the past 4 years where she’s worked on six short films. Recently, she began mentoring film students at Orange High School in New Jersey.
